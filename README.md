# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

There are several sorting algorithms for data in an array or a list and each have their own time complexity calculations.
Big O notation is the time complexity calculation that approximates the average time taken by an algorithm to sort a given set of data.

In this project, working examples of some algorithms are included like:
 * Bubble Sort
 * Insertion Sort (linked list)
 * Selection Sort
 * Quick Sort

** More can be added in due time **
